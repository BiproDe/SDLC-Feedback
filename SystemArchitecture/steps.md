# System Architecture Testing Steps - E-commerce Platform Focus

## General Testing Approach

### Pre-Test Setup (5 minutes)
1. **Open VS Code**
2. **Open Copilot Chat** (`Ctrl+Shift+I`)
3. **Clear previous context** - Start fresh for architecture testing
4. **Start timer** for tracking response times
5. **Have this prompt file open** for easy copy-paste

### Test Execution Steps

#### Step 1: Initial Architecture Prompt Testing (10-15 minutes)
1. **Copy the primary prompt** from TC-INF-001
2. **Paste into Copilot Chat**
3. **Record start time**
4. **Wait for response** and record response time
5. **Evaluate completeness** against expected output
6. **Rate technical accuracy** (1-10 scale)

#### Step 2: Architecture Follow-up Questions (15-20 minutes)

**For TC-INF-001 (E-commerce Platform Architecture):**
1. "What if we need to reduce the RTO to 30 minutes instead of 1 hour?"
2. "How would this architecture change if we expect 2 million daily users instead of 500K?"
3. "Can you provide specific Azure services and SKUs for each component?"
4. "How would you handle Black Friday traffic that's 20x normal volume?"
5. "What monitoring alerts would you set up for this architecture?"
6. "How would you implement the payment gateway integration securely?"
7. "What would be the estimated monthly cost for this architecture?"
8. "How would you handle database failover in the disaster recovery scenario?"

8. "Can you generate pipeline variables and variable groups for different environments?"

#### Step 5: Monitoring and Observability Testing (15-20 minutes)

**For TC-INF-001-MONITORING (Observability):**

**Initial Monitoring Prompt Testing:**
1. **Copy TC-INF-001-MONITORING prompt** and paste into chat

4. "Can you create alert rules for critical business metrics (transaction failures, payment issues)?"
5. "What capacity planning and forecasting strategies would you implement?"
6. "How would you integrate with on-call systems like PagerDuty?"
7. "Can you generate custom metrics and dashboards for business KPIs?"
8. "What distributed tracing strategy would you implement across microservices?"

#### Step 6: Security Implementation Testing (15-20 minutes)

**For TC-INF-001-SECURITY (Security & Compliance):**

**Initial Security Prompt Testing:**
1. **Copy TC-INF-001-SECURITY prompt** and paste into chat
2. **Evaluate PCI DSS compliance** approach
3. **Check security configurations** and best practices

**Security Follow-up Questions:**
1. "Can you generate specific Network Security Group rules for PCI DSS compliance?"
2. "How would you implement Azure Key Vault configurations for different environments?"
3. "What specific Azure AD B2C policies would you configure for customer authentication?"
4. "Can you create Azure Security Center policies for compliance monitoring?"
5. "How would you implement data encryption at rest and in transit for all components?"
6. "What vulnerability scanning and penetration testing procedures would you recommend?"
7. "Can you generate security incident response runbooks and procedures?"
8. "How would you implement automated compliance reporting and audit trails?"

## Advanced Integration Testing (20-30 minutes)

### Cross-Component Integration Testing:
Test how well the agent can tie together architecture, IaC, DevOps, monitoring, and security:

1. **"How would the Terraform modules integrate with the Azure DevOps pipelines for infrastructure deployment?"**
2. **"Can you create a complete deployment workflow that includes infrastructure provisioning, application deployment, and monitoring setup?"**
3. **"How would you implement GitOps practices with the infrastructure and application code?"**
4. **"Can you generate a disaster recovery automation script that uses the monitoring alerts to trigger failover procedures?"**
5. **"How would you implement compliance-as-code that validates security configurations during deployment?"**
6. **"Can you create a complete environment promotion strategy (dev → staging → prod) with all components?"**
