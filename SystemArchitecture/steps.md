# System Architecture Testing Steps

## General Testing Approach

### Pre-Test Setup (5 minutes)
1. **Open VS Code**
2. **Open Copilot Chat** (`Ctrl+Shift+I`)
3. **Clear previous context** - Start fresh for architecture testing
4. **Start timer** for tracking response times
5. **Have this prompt file open** for easy copy-paste

### Test Execution Steps

#### Step 1: Initial Prompt Testing (10-15 minutes)
1. **Copy the primary prompt** from prompt.md
2. **Paste into Copilot Chat**
3. **Record start time**
4. **Wait for response** and record response time
5. **Evaluate completeness** against expected output
6. **Rate technical accuracy** (1-10 scale)

#### Step 2: Follow-up Questions (15-20 minutes)
Test the agent's depth and adaptability with these follow-up questions:

**For TC-INF-001 (E-commerce Platform):**
1. "What if we need to reduce the RTO to 30 minutes instead of 1 hour?"
2. "How would this architecture change if we expect 5 million daily users instead of 500K?"
3. "Can you provide specific AWS/Azure services for each component?"
4. "Generate Terraform code for the core infrastructure components"
5. "How would you handle Black Friday traffic that's 20x normal volume?"
6. "What monitoring alerts would you set up for this architecture?"

**For TC-INF-002 (Microservices Migration):**
1. "How would you handle distributed transactions across microservices?"
2. "What if one of the external APIs has poor performance - how do we handle that?"
3. "Can you create Kubernetes YAML manifests for the main services?"
4. "How would you implement circuit breakers in this architecture?"
5. "What database per service strategy would you recommend?"
6. "How would you handle service discovery and load balancing?"

**For TC-INF-011 (Multi-Cloud Strategy):**
1. "What if AWS goes down for 4 hours - how does the failover work?"
2. "How would you handle data sovereignty requirements for European customers?"
3. "Can you provide specific networking configurations for cross-cloud connectivity?"
4. "What are the cost implications of this multi-cloud approach?"
5. "How would you implement unified identity management across clouds?"

**For TC-INF-012 (Legacy Modernization):**
1. "What if we can only have 2-hour maintenance windows on weekends?"
2. "How would you handle the integration with the 20+ business applications during migration?"
3. "What if the historical data has quality issues - how do we clean it?"
4. "Can you provide a detailed timeline for this modernization project?"
5. "How would you train the operations team on the new cloud-native system?"

#### Step 3: Deep Technical Testing (10-15 minutes)
Push for specific technical details:

1. **Request Code Generation:**
   - "Generate Infrastructure as Code templates"
   - "Provide monitoring configurations"
   - "Create deployment scripts"

2. **Challenge Edge Cases:**
   - "What happens if this component fails?"
   - "How do you handle security breaches?"
   - "What if costs exceed budget by 50%?"

3. **Ask for Best Practices:**
   - "What industry standards should we follow?"
   - "How do you ensure compliance with regulations?"
   - "What are the operational procedures?"

#### Step 4: Evaluation and Documentation (10 minutes)
1. **Copy the entire conversation** to a text file
2. **Fill out the feedback form** immediately
3. **Save results** in TestResults folder
4. **Rate overall satisfaction** with the agent's performance

## Evaluation Criteria

### Technical Accuracy (1-10 Scale)
- **9-10**: Expert-level technical solutions, industry best practices
- **7-8**: Good technical approach with minor gaps
- **5-6**: Basic technical accuracy but missing key elements
- **3-4**: Some technical issues or misconceptions
- **1-2**: Major technical flaws or incorrect approaches

### Completeness (1-10 Scale)
- **9-10**: Addresses all requirements comprehensively
- **7-8**: Covers most requirements with minor omissions
- **5-6**: Covers basic requirements but misses some important aspects
- **3-4**: Significant gaps in addressing requirements
- **1-2**: Fails to address most requirements

### Best Practices (1-10 Scale)
- **9-10**: Follows all industry best practices and standards
- **7-8**: Generally follows best practices with minor deviations
- **5-6**: Some best practices followed, others missed
- **3-4**: Limited adherence to best practices
- **1-2**: Poor or no adherence to best practices

### Practical Implementation (1-10 Scale)
- **9-10**: Ready for production implementation with minimal changes
- **7-8**: Good foundation, needs minor modifications
- **5-6**: Requires significant modifications for production use
- **3-4**: Major rework needed for practical implementation
- **1-2**: Not practically implementable

## Time Saving Assessment

### Estimate Manual Time vs Agent-Assisted Time
- **Manual Architecture Document Creation**: 8-16 hours
- **Agent-Assisted Creation**: 2-4 hours + review time
- **Time Saving Calculation**: ((Manual Time - Agent Time) / Manual Time) Ã— 100

### Quality Outcome Categories
- **Exceptional**: Exceeds expectations, minimal human intervention needed
- **Above Expectation**: Good quality output, minor human refinement needed
- **Acceptable**: Basic quality, moderate human intervention required
- **Unacceptable**: Poor quality, extensive rework needed
