# How to Test GHCP Agents Using VS Code - Vibe Coding Mode

## üöÄ Setup Instructions for Testing

### Step 1: VS Code and GitHub Copilot Setup
1. **Ensure VS Code is Updated**
   - Open VS Code
   - Go to Help ‚Üí Check for Updates
   - Install any available updates

2. **Verify GitHub Copilot Extension**
   - Go to Extensions (Ctrl+Shift+X)
   - Search for "GitHub Copilot"
   - Ensure both "GitHub Copilot" and "GitHub Copilot Chat" are installed and enabled
   - Sign in to your GitHub account if prompted

3. **Access Copilot Chat (Agent Mode)**
   - Press `Ctrl+Shift+I` or click the chat icon in the Activity Bar
   - This opens the GitHub Copilot Chat panel (this is your "Vibe Coding" interface)

### Step 2: Prepare Your Testing Environment
1. **Create a Testing Workspace**
   - Create a new folder for each test session (e.g., "GHCP_Testing_Aug7")
   - Open this folder in VS Code (`File ‚Üí Open Folder`)

2. **Organize Your Test Files**
   - Keep your test cases document open in VS Code
   - Create separate folders for each deliverable type you're testing
   - Example structure:
   ```
   GHCP_Testing_Aug7/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SystemArchitecture/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ SecurityDesign/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ DataDesign/
   ‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ IntegrationDesign/
   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ TestResults/
   ```

## üß™ How to Execute Tests Using Vibe Coding

### Testing Process for Each Test Case:

#### Step 1: Start a New Chat Session
1. **Open Copilot Chat** (`Ctrl+Shift+I`)
2. **Clear Previous Context** - Start each major test with a fresh chat session
3. **Set Context** (if needed):
   ```
   I'm working as an Infrastructure SME and need help with [specific deliverable type]
   ```

#### Step 2: Execute Your Test Prompt
1. **Copy the exact prompt** from your test case document
2. **Paste into Copilot Chat**
3. **Press Enter and start your timer**

**Example for TC-INF-001:**
```
Design a system architecture for an e-commerce platform that handles 500K daily active users, 
processes $10M in transactions monthly, and requires 99.95% uptime. The system must support 
flash sales with 10x traffic spikes, integrate with multiple payment gateways, and comply 
with PCI DSS requirements. Include disaster recovery for RPO=4hrs, RTO=1hr.
```

#### Step 3: Evaluate the Response
1. **Time the response** - Note how long Copilot takes to respond
2. **Review completeness** against your expected outputs
3. **Test follow-up questions** to gauge depth of knowledge

#### Step 4: Test Follow-up Scenarios
Ask clarifying questions to test the agent's adaptability:
```
"What if we need to reduce the RTO to 30 minutes?"
"How would this architecture change for 2x the transaction volume?"
"Can you provide specific Azure/AWS services for this implementation?"
"Generate Terraform code for the core infrastructure components"
```

#### Step 5: Document Results
1. **Copy the full conversation** to a text file
2. **Fill out your feedback template** immediately
3. **Save in your TestResults folder**

## üìä Practical Testing Example

### Sample Testing Session:

1. **Open VS Code**
2. **Open Copilot Chat** (`Ctrl+Shift+I`)
3. **Start Timer** 
4. **Input Test Prompt:**

```
Design a system architecture for an e-commerce platform that handles 500K daily active users, 
processes $10M in transactions monthly, and requires 99.95% uptime. The system must support 
flash sales with 10x traffic spikes, integrate with multiple payment gateways, and comply 
with PCI DSS requirements. Include disaster recovery for RPO=4hrs, RTO=1hr.
```

5. **Wait for Response** (note the time)
6. **Ask Follow-up Questions:**
   - "Can you provide specific AWS services for this architecture?"
   - "How would you implement the auto-scaling for flash sales?"
   - "What monitoring tools would you recommend?"

7. **Evaluate and Document**

## üéØ Advanced Testing Techniques

### Context Building Test
Test if the agent can build upon previous responses:
1. Start with basic architecture request
2. Add security requirements in follow-up
3. Add monitoring requirements next
4. Finally add disaster recovery

### Code Generation Test
For IaC-related deliverables:
1. Ask for architecture design first
2. Then request: "Generate Terraform/ARM templates for this architecture"
3. Evaluate the generated code quality

### Problem-Solving Test
Present a problem scenario:
```
"The architecture you designed is experiencing 3-second response times during peak hours. 
The database CPU is at 80%, and the web servers are at 60% CPU. How would you optimize this?"
```

## üö¶ Testing Tips & Best Practices

### DO:
- ‚úÖ Test during different times to see consistency
- ‚úÖ Use real-world scenarios from your experience
- ‚úÖ Challenge the agent with edge cases
- ‚úÖ Test both high-level design and specific implementation
- ‚úÖ Document everything immediately after testing
- ‚úÖ Save the full conversation history

### DON'T:
- ‚ùå Don't test multiple deliverables in the same chat session
- ‚ùå Don't rush through tests - give adequate time for evaluation
- ‚ùå Don't assume the first response is the best the agent can do
- ‚ùå Don't forget to test follow-up questions and iterations

### Time Management:
- **Simple Tests**: 15-20 minutes
- **Complex Tests**: 30-45 minutes  
- **Advanced Scenario Tests**: 45-60 minutes

### Quality Indicators to Watch For:
1. **Specificity**: Does it provide specific technology names and configurations?
2. **Completeness**: Does it address all requirements in your prompt?
3. **Best Practices**: Does it follow industry standards?
4. **Scalability**: Does it consider growth and scaling?
5. **Security**: Are security aspects integrated throughout?
6. **Cost Awareness**: Does it consider cost optimization?

## üìÖ Testing Schedule Recommendation

**Week 1 (Aug 7-11)**: Core Infrastructure Deliverables
- Day 1-2: System Architecture test cases
- Day 3-4: Security Design test cases  
- Day 5: Data Design test cases

**Week 2 (Aug 12-14)**: Advanced and Integration Testing
- Day 1: Integration Design test cases
- Day 2: Additional Infrastructure test cases
- Day 3: Compile feedback and final testing

Remember: Your goal is to determine if these agents can genuinely help infrastructure teams be more productive while maintaining quality and best practices!
