#### Step 3: Deep DevOps Architecture Testing (15-20 minutes)

**Pipeline Architecture Deep Dive:**
1. "Can you design the complete pipeline architecture with all components?"
2. "How would you implement pipeline as code with version control?"
3. "What branching strategies would work best with this pipeline?"

**Automation and Tooling:**
1. "How would you automate infrastructure provisioning and configuration?"
2. "What monitoring and alerting would you implement for pipeline health?"
3. "How would you implement automated rollback triggers?"

**Performance and Scalability:**
1. "How would you optimize pipeline execution time and resource usage?"
2. "What strategies would you use for parallel execution and job optimization?"
3. "How would you handle pipeline scaling during high-demand periods?"

**Security and Compliance:**
1. "How would you implement least-privilege access in the pipeline?"
2. "What audit trails and compliance reporting would you maintain?"
3. "How would you handle sensitive data and credentials throughout the pipeline?"

#### Step 4: Practical Implementation Testing (10-15 minutes)

**Request Specific Configurations:**
1. **Pipeline Code**: "Generate CI/CD pipeline configuration files"
2. **Container Configs**: "Provide Dockerfile and Kubernetes manifests"
3. **IaC Templates**: "Create infrastructure provisioning scripts"
4. **Monitoring Setup**: "Generate monitoring and alerting configurations"

**Test Complex Scenarios:**
1. "How do you handle pipeline failures during production deployments?"
2. "What happens when multiple teams need to deploy simultaneously?"
3. "How do you manage pipeline dependencies and shared resources?"
