# Integration Design Testing Steps

## General Testing Approach

### Pre-Test Setup (5 minutes)
1. **Open VS Code**
2. **Open Copilot Chat** (`Ctrl+Shift+I`)
3. **Start new session** focused on integration architecture
4. **Prepare timing tools**
5. **Have integration design prompts ready**

### Test Execution Steps

#### Step 1: Initial Integration Testing (10-15 minutes)
1. **Copy primary prompt** from prompt.md
2. **Paste into Copilot Chat**
3. **Record response time**
4. **Evaluate integration architecture comprehensiveness**
5. **Rate integration expertise level** (1-10 scale)

#### Step 2: Integration-Specific Follow-up Questions (20-25 minutes)

**For TC-INF-006 (API Gateway and Service Mesh):**
1. "What specific API gateway technology would you recommend (Kong, AWS API Gateway, etc.)?"

4. "Can you provide data mapping and transformation examples?"
5. "How would you implement SLA monitoring and partner dashboards?"
6. "What security measures are specific to B2B integrations?"
7. "How would you handle different partner authentication methods?"
8. "What compliance requirements (like AS2, SFTP) would you support?"

**For TC-INF-020 (Real-time Data Integration):**
1. "What streaming technologies would you use (Kafka, Pulsar, Kinesis)?"
2. "How would you achieve sub-millisecond latency requirements?"
3. "What specific optimizations would you implement for high-throughput processing?"
4. "Can you provide streaming pipeline configurations and code?"
5. "How would you implement exactly-once processing semantics?"
6. "What fault tolerance mechanisms would you use?"
7. "How would you handle back-pressure and flow control?"
8. "What regulatory compliance measures are needed for financial data?"

#### Step 3: Deep Integration Architecture Testing (15-20 minutes)

**Integration Patterns Deep Dive:**
1. "Can you explain the specific integration patterns you would use?"
2. "How would you implement saga patterns for distributed transactions?"
3. "What event-driven architecture patterns would you apply?"

**Error Handling and Resilience:**
1. "How would you implement retry mechanisms with exponential backoff?"
2. "What circuit breaker patterns would you use?"
3. "How would you handle partial failures in distributed integrations?"

**Performance and Scalability:**
1. "How would you design for 10x growth in integration volume?"
2. "What caching strategies would you implement?"
3. "How would you implement horizontal scaling for integration services?"

**Security and Compliance:**
1. "What integration-specific security measures would you implement?"
2. "How would you handle data privacy in cross-system integrations?"
3. "What audit trails would you maintain for integration activities?"

#### Step 4: Practical Implementation Testing (10-15 minutes)

**Request Specific Configurations:**
1. **API Gateway Configs**: "Generate API gateway configuration files"
2. **Message Broker Setup**: "Provide message queue and broker configurations"
3. **Integration Code**: "Generate integration service code examples"
4. **Monitoring Setup**: "Create integration monitoring and alerting configurations"

**Test Complex Scenarios:**
1. "How do you handle integration failures during peak traffic?"
2. "What happens when a downstream system becomes unavailable?"
3. "How do you manage schema evolution across integrated systems?"
